2 tablespoon(here on shown as tbl.) yeast dissolved in 1/2 cup warm water - sprinkle 1 tbl. sugar on top and set aside until it is "foamy"
put 7 cups flour in a large bowl and make a well in the center
mix 3 eggs in the center of the flour (in the well)
to the eggs, add:  1/2 cup oil
                           1/4 cup or more sugar to your taste
                           1 1/2 cups warm water
                           2 tsp. salt
                           the yeast mixture
			   add some vanilla

stir together until dough forms and then knead with your hands for about 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic
cover the bowl with a clean, damp dish towel and let it rise until double - about 45 mins - 1 hour.
punch down the dough to its original size (you can refrigerate the dough now overnight.  just spray some spray oil on the surface of the dough and cover it with plastic wrap.  if you do this, take the dough out the next day and let it rise again before proceeding).  let rise again and punch down again.  this recipe makes one rather large challah, or 2 small ones.  if you make one challah, you can divide the dough into either 6 or 4 pieces and roll them into ropes then braid - 2 smaller challahs can either be 3 or 4 ropes each for braiding.  i sprinkle some cinnamon and sugar on the counter and roll each rope in some before i braid - but you do not have to do this.
place on a greased cookie sheet (or put parchment paper on the cookie sheet) and cover challah to rise til double one more time (be careful not to let it over rise - get really puffy- because this will actually cause the challah to cook flat.
beat one egg with 1 tsp. of sugar and brush the top of the challah.  sprinkle with sesame or poppy seeds if you desire.
bake the large challah for about 40 minutes - 350 degrees
small challahs bake for about 25 minutes - 350 degrees

the top should be nice and brown and when you tap the top of the challah with a finger, it should sound hollow.
