4 - 5 large potatoes - grated
1 large onion - grated

put these together and try to squeeze out as much liquid as you can.
then mix this with:

salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste
2 eggs
1/4 or 1/3 cup flour

mix well then fry.  the trick is to use more rather than less oil, and to make certain it is really hot.  also, make certain it is seasoned well with salt, pepper and garlic.  if you are going to keep them warm in the oven, try to put them on a rack so that there is air flow all the way around the latkes.  if you don't have a rack, put them on a cookie sheet, but don't stack them - lay them singly on the tray.
